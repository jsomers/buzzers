buzzers
=======

At our apartment we recently hosted a small reunion of [Quiz Bowlers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_bowl). I made a small "buzzer system" for the toss-up questions. Usage:

1. Download [the HTML file](https://raw.github.com/jsomers/buzzers/master/buzzers.html) to your Desktop. Open it in a browser.

2. Download a program for connecting Wii remotes to your computer via bluetooth. Here's [a zip file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jsomers/darwiin_remotes.zip) with seven copies of the program, one for each remote.

3. Assign each remote's "A" button to the keyboard keys, **a**-**g**.

4. Open the buzzers.html HTML file. Click the "Change Players" link. If you hit the "A" button on a remote, the input box it correponds to will flash. Write the player holding that remote into the box.

5. Save your changes. Now when anyone clicks their Wii remote their name will flash on the screen. Nobody else can "buzz in" until the screen is cleared (by hitting spacebar).

6. Hook it up to a TV for maximum fun!
